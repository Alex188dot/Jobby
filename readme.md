# Job Search Exercise

This Job Search Portal contains a feature for which you can filter jobs by title and location. The app uses a sample data set of job objects and filters them according to your input. The filtered jobs are displayed in a table with links to the job websites (in this case it will just take you to indeed.com). You can see the web app in action here: https://alex188dot.github.io/Jobby/

Here is a preview of how it looks:

## How to Use It

To get started click here: https://alex188dot.github.io/Jobby/. Then, type in a job title and a location in the boxes and click the Search button or press the Enter key. The app will show you the matching jobs and the number of results. Example, if you type "customer" it will show you all the jobs matching that keyword, see below:

If, on top of that you search for location and type for example "us", it will show you all the jobs matching the keyword customer, in the US:
