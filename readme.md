# Job Search Exercise

Welcome to the final project of Month 2 at Epicode, where I practiced creating algorithms with a web app that searches for jobs by title and location. The app uses a sample data set of job objects and filters them according to your input. The filtered jobs are displayed in a table with links to the job websites. You can see the web app in action here: https://alex188dot.github.io/Jobby/

Whereas here is a preview of how it looks:

## How to Use It

To get started, open the jobby.html file in your web browser. Then, type in a job title and a location in the boxes and click the Search button or press the Enter key. The app will show you the matching jobs and the number of results. You can click on the job titles to go to Indeed.com.

## How It Works

This project uses JavaScript to create functions that filter the data. It also uses HTML and CSS to create the web page layout and style. The code is commented to explain what each part does. You can view the code in your code editor or on GitHub.
